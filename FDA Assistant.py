    ## How It Works:
    1. Upload a document (such as a bank statement or invoice).
    2. The AI will analyze the document and allow you to ask questions about the extracted data.
    3. Receive AI-generated insights based on the content of the document.

    **Try asking about specific transactions, anomalies, or ask for a summary of the document's key details!**
